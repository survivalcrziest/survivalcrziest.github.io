>“We are called to be the architects of the future, not its victims.” ―R. B. Fuller

## About Me
I’m Kartik, a product management & engineering leader with 20 years of tech experience spanning aviation training, public safety, healthcare, climate tech — and most recently, enterprise GenAI. I’ve had the privilege to build and lead teams in 5 countries. I’ve been a developer, enterprise architect, engineering manager and 2x co-founder before I embraced product management full-time. You can find my bio, contact and links to my writing & projects at [hellokartik.com](https://www.hellokartik.com/) .

I'm [@survivalcrziest](https://github.com/survivalcrziest) on GitHub and elsewhere on the web.


## In this Site
If you're a Product Leader, Product Manager or UX Designer feeling lost in the GenAI maze, you'll find resources here that will help you chart a clear path forward. [The GenAI Discovery Project](ai/index.md) is where I share my learning in public.


## Other Projects
I write weekly briefs on what I’m learning, observing and thinking about GenAI - with an additional emphasis on Climate Tech: [The Product Leadership Journal](https://productleadershipjournal.substack.com) .


## Collaboration
A lot of the content here is co-created using AI (Claude and Vercel v0). Mindmaps are rendered using [Markmap](https://github.com/markmap/markmap) or [ExcaliDraw](https://excalidraw.com/) .
