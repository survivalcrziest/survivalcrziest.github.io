## About Me
I am an AI & SaaS Product Leader at Microsoft.  You can find my bio, contact and links to my writing & projects at [hellokartik.com](https://www.hellokartik.com/) .

I'm [@survivalcrziest](https://github.com/survivalcrziest) on GitHub and elsewhere on the web.


## In this Site
If you're a Product Leader, Product Manager or UX Designer feeling lost in the GenAI maze, you'll find resources here that will help you chart a clear path forward. [The GenAI Discovery Project](ai/index.md) is where I share my learning in public.


## Other Projects
I write a weekly newsletter with curated resources for AI Product Leaders: [The Product Leadership Journal](https://productleadershipjournal.substack.com) .

I curate resources at the intersection of climate tech and product at [PlanetProduct](https://planetproduct.notion.site/Planet-Product-22ad24d2dbda80cd9871c316f1e96552) .


## Collaboration
A lot of the content here is co-created using AI (Claude and Vercel v0). Mindmaps are rendered using [Markmap](https://github.com/markmap/markmap) or [ExcaliDraw](https://excalidraw.com/) .
