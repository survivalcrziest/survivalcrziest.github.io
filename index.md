### About Me
I am an AI & SaaS Product Leader at Microsoft.  You can find my bio, contact and links to my writing & projects at [hellokartik.com](https://www.hellokartik.com/)


### In this Site
[The GenAI Discovery Project](ai/index.md) is where I share my learning in public.

If you're a Product Leader, Product Manager or UX Designer feeling lost in the GenAI maze, you'll find resources here that will help you chart a clear path forward.


### Collaboration
A lot of the content here is co-created using AI (Claude and Vercel v0). Mindmaps are rendered using [Markmap](https://github.com/markmap/markmap) or [ExcaliDraw](https://excalidraw.com/).

If you have suggestions, follow up questions or ideas for collaborating on the content here, please reach out to me: [hellokartik.com](https://www.hellokartik.com/)
